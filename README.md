# Learning and experimenting

This repository is meant for me (flupsi) to learn nice things and try them out. I have a capricious memory, so this place will serve as an archive of what and how I am learning, especially when I run against a wall.

Check out my [notes](./notes.md). Or jump right into my stories...
