# "D.I.Y. A.T.M.": _An easy and useful method for distributing money within your communities_

## How it works

1. Connect with peers you **trust**, and that you want to **share abundance** with
2. **Deposit money** at any time you have more than you need
3. **Withdraw money** whenever you need/want it (and receive it almost instantly)
4. Never feel bad or worried about your money situation again!

## Preconditions

- Sometimes some of us are in dire straits, but overall, we have an **abundance** of wealth. We don't need or want to hoard money individually (for example because it makes us sick or because we don't believe in "earning" money)
- We **trust** the community to make good money decisions. I may have some ideas where we put our money, and so do my friends. We don't need hierarchies or majority decisions because we trust each member of the community to make the right call, and we can always talk to each other.
- We acknowledge that wage-labor and debt and violent dispossession are the tools of the ultra-rich and the warlords to exploit the planet and all living beings. Among each other, we can simply gift instead of sell. But when we want to interact with money-based economies, we need to cultivate money-practices that serve our communities and not the extraction-machine.

## Scope

**A community with TRUST and ABUNDANCE can start an A.T.M. to distribute money internally.**

The A.T.M. is just one way to deal with money in a less harmful way than, say, having only private bank accounts, or paying each other for work, or competing with each other for scarce resources, or doing debts. Participants of an A.T.M. can tell each other, "I have more money than I currently need", or "I need/want more money than I currently have", and then they "automatically" transfer money among each other.

Many of us grew up with the idea that money has to be earned. The flipside being that poverty is your own fault. But we clearly see that poverty and dispossession and inequality and scarcity and debt are created by the wealthy in order to enslave the global majority. So let's decouple money from individual "financial success" and instead celebrate our collective abundance. 

There are many viable practices of collective finances. **Here's what makes the A.T.M. special:**

1. **Autonomous:** Every participant of an ATM is only accountable to themselves. No majority decisions, no scrutiny or judgement. There is also no global ATM authority, just an accessible, evolving practice of starting and ending ATMs.
2. **Informal:** We don't need banks or contracts or formal roles. We build on the mutual trust and care and love and patience and capacities we already have.
3. **Temporary:** A.T.M.s are meant to fail. Leave when you feel like it, with grace. The risk is quite limited for everyone.

The A.T.M. does not come with instructions on how to spend or get money, or how to self-organize as a community. That's outside of the scope. It's just about distributing money within a community in a minimalistic and useful way.

## Should we start an A.T.M.

... or find a different way to manage money collectively? 

- You have **strong mutual trust and some financial abundance** within the group? **Only then: YES, start your A.T.M!**
- You have trust and shared purpose but no abundance? Fundraising, Soli events, ransom, or (carefully!) sucking NGO/EU money may be ways for you to get the money you need.
- You have a shared purpose and some financial padding but still need to build deep mutual trust? Then find a more formal way to make decisions about collective spending.
- You have money but no mutual trust? Then be charitable and give to fundraisers.
- You have strong mutual trust but neither shared purpose nor financial abundance? Leave Babylon immediately and live the rest of your lives on the rainbow gatherings. Or join some industrious community if that's more your thing.
- You have none of the above? Embrace the labor market ;-)

## Comparison

Why not keep **a shared bank account**?

- **Discrimination:** With a shared bank account, the bank manages all access. A bank account is usually tied to a "legal" person, and potential disputes go through a discriminatory judicial system. This makes it hard for members of a collective to decide freely and equally. In addition, banks rate everyone's credit worthiness, and report to governments and private corporations. With an A.T.M., all those institootions are out of the equation. It's just the community and some money. You can decide how to make decisions. And nobody is barred from access due to low credit rating or political discrimination.
- **Speculation:** With a shared bank account, the bank is using the deposited money to speculate on the market, contributing to wars and climate change. In contrast, with an A.T.M., your money 100% goes towards community causes instead.

Why not have **a jar with money**?

- **No idle money:** Once you put money into the jar, it just sits there (until someone has a use for it) In contrast, when you use the A.T.M., you still have all your money on your own account (or purse). If you get an unexpected invoice, you still have the money you need. Only when someone in the community withdraws the money to use it, you actually transfer it. The collective wealth in the A.T.M. is not actual money but rather the promise of money. By the way, this is similar to how banks "create" money.
- **Move money around:** An A.T.M. can span many locations. You can share money with friends in different continents. The only precondition is that there is a way to make money transfers once someone "withdraws" money.

Why not **make collective decisions about spending**?

- This can work, too. You can form an informal collective and manage part of your money in a regular budget circle. What's special about the A.T.M. is that it allows each peer completely autonomous decisions. It's your decision what model works best for each of the communities you are part of. In communities with a shared purpose, the collective decisionmaking model might work better, whereas in a community based primarily on mutual trust, the A.T.M. may give each of you more agency and simplicity.

Why not **just transfer money directly to those in need**?

- This is what I see a lot in the communities. People and groups in need start a GoFundMe campaign or a fundraiser, and those who have more than they need chime in with their money. In rarer occasions, people who just got big money themselves ask around who needs money. In an A.T.M., you can skip much of the work. You just **deposit** or **withdraw**, and that's it. No need to create elaburate narratives for a fundraiser, no need to compete with fellow fundraisers, no need to ask everyone if they need something. **It's the same, just easier**.

## Questions and Answers

**Does it work?**

Yes. But an A.T.M. may not live long, so don't expect too much from the first try. For me, the great thing about "giving up" money without tracing how it is spent was that I learned to identify less with "my" money. And that in turn made it easier for me to ask my friends for money when I needed it down the line. So I now worry less about internalized debt with friends. It's not a recipy for abundance but it helps some way, it feels liberating. Right now (writing this in early June 2025), there is only one A.T.M., so start your A.T.M. and report what you find!

**Our A.T.M. is dead.** What can we do?

Is seems you either ran out of money or out of trust. Just start over with new constellations. A.T.M.s are meant to be short-lived!

**One of our members always withdraws all of the A.T.M. money!**

Yes, good for them :-)

Also, if their neediness makes you uneasy, ask yourself whether you still want to be in an A.T.M. with them. From my side, you don't have any moral obligations.

**Can I deposit money I don't actually have?**

Yes, but it's risky. In case someone withdraws your deposit, one of the following may happen:

(a) You take an expensive loan from your bank to fulfill the trasfer of money

(b) You cancel the transfer (undoing your deposit)

Both may lead to frustration and less mutual trust. Only go that route if you are sure you will be able to fulfill the transfer, and be frank about it with your peers.

In the future, it may be interesting to distribute risks collectively (like the banks and nation-states do).

**I have 100 money on my Bank account. Can I deposit 100,- on each of my A.T.M.s now?**

Yes, especially if those A.T.M.s have different people participating, to make sure nobody withdraws this money from several A.T.M.s at once. Also make sure that as soon as 100,- are withdrawn from one A.T.M., withdraw the others immediately.

**Can I leave an A.T.M.?**

Yes, at any time, with grace, and without an explanation. It's part of the deal.

**Do I need to justify my spending?**

Yes, always! But only to yourself. Your A.T.M. community trusts you to do the right thing. And your peers are always there to if you need their help with financial decisions. But they will never scrutinize and judge your call. 

That's really what sets this form apart from other ways of collective finance!

**Can I give money I withdraw to a friend who is not in the A.T.M.?**

Yes, you can do anything with the money as long as you feel it's the right thing. The special idea of it being a machine is that the other members of the A.T.M. don't need to bother with how the money is spent. If you feel unsure about the use of A.T.M. money, and you desire your peers to co-decide with you, then check out the alternative model "collective decisionmaking" mentioned in the comparison section above. Or invite your friend to join/launch an A.T.M. so they can withdraw what they need themselves.

**What does "A.T.M." mean?**

Yes, it means "Autonomous Collective Liquidity Machine", abbreviated _ColFin_ (like the dolphin, just with collective fin(ance)s). Alternative spelling: CoFi Machine. It can be automated.

Jokes aside, yeah, the name A.T.M. _is_ kinda lame. And very confusing. Please [send me better ideas!](https://codeberg.org/upsiflu/learning-and-experimenting/issues/new)

**Do I need to install an app to join an A.T.M.?**

No. We have a functioning A.T.M. that uses a Signal chat, and we could do the same by telephone or on a sheet of paper or orally. An A.T.M. requires very little bookkeeping. You just have to remember the current amount of **deposit** for each participant, and any time there is a **withdrawal**, some algorithm decides who transfers their deposit to fulfill it. Also, you cannot withdraw more than there is in deposits. And when you withdraw all of your deposit, it just makes your deposit equal zero (no actual money transfer needed).

(I'd love to make an app, though. Just to make it even more convenient and safe and detached.)

**What? Algorithm?**

Yes. When there is a withdrawal, someone has to pay. To prevent confusion, the community has to decide upfront how they share the transfers. The easiest algorithm ("Quickest responder") just says, once a depositor sees there is an open withdrawal, they immediately fulfill it.

Here is a list of some useful algorithms:

- "Quickest responder": When there is a withdrawal, the quickest depositor to respond pays. If the withdrawal is larger than that deposit, the next depositor to respond pays. Etc.
- "First-in-first-out": When there is a withdrawal, the oldest deposit has to pay it. If the withdrawal is higher, then the second oldest deposit pays. Etc.
- "Last-in-first-out": When there is a withdrawal, the most recent deposit has to pay it. If the withdrawal is higher, then the second most recent deposit pays. Etc.
- "Dice roll": When there is a withdrawal, a dice roll decides which deposit needs to pay. If that deposit is not enough, the procedure is repeated. And so on.
- "Equal share: When there is a withdrawal, each deposit is reduced by the same percentage.

There are also a lot of possible-but-not-useful algorithms. For example, an algorithm "Fairness" would keep a record of past transfers and try to balance everyone's share. This runs counter to the whole idea of the A.T.M.
