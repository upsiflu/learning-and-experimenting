# Community Experience Patterns

_UX patterns for designers and engineers who want to build and maintain community-centric platforms._

## Focus and disclosure

Humans have a tiny active memory. Hide irrelevant parts of the model and provide means to disclose them progressively.

## Moving through space and time

Spatial and temporal vectors are the easiest dimensions to navigate. Lay out information and actions across these dimensions.

## Mutual awareness

Make social relations, interactions, and processes explicit. Give peer presence and agency permanent representation.

## Learning, suggestion, guidance

Always provide the "next step" for users who get confused or curious (or both). Avoid manipulative and deceptive patterns.

## Don't build it yourself

Appropriate existing infrastructure. Use protocols, channels, metaphors, codes that others have built. Let users bring in their community practices and patterns. Rely on plugins, not 'batteries included'.

## Rotting gracefully

Everything will die eventually. Set failure criteria, plan for deprecation, embrace death. Abundance will still be, elsewhere.

## Care over creation

The world is not a blank slate. Code for maintainability first, everything else second. Design for care, not for power. Disclose all externalities.

## Design is for agency

Every app is a community language. Provide few, highly composable expressions for the community to articulate its processes transparently. To. prevent frustration, clearly communicate upfront the agency a user has.
