# Software design, curation and development cooperative

## The beginning

We start with the magician (major arcanum I), the beginning and the choice. A previous circle has ended.

> "I, The Magician, take a position in the crossroads of eternity and infinity that we call the present. I am loyal to everything that I am: my body, my intelligence, my heart, my creative force. My table of flesh has its three feet rooted in the ground; I anchor myself somewhere in the diversity, and it is from this point that I take action."

**Abundance!**

It's raining money. The mass of capital is growing exponentially. Let's opt out of artificial scarcity and into abundance. Let's opportunistically collect what we can, and funnel it into community projects. Let's shower in creativity, joy and celebration.

The Empress (major arcanum III):

> "It is I who colors the entire Earth green after winter. It is I who fill the sky with birds and the oceans with fish. When I say 'create,' I mean transformation. It is I who cause the seed to burst and the sprout to emerge. (...) I am the pleasure of being who you are, without prejudice or morals."

> "Do not remain caged up in your fortified castle! Make it a temple with all its doors and windows open: all emotions are at your disposal, like a rainbow of subtleties."

**Cooperation!**

In a cooperative, formally independent workers bring together their complementary skills. I'm good at design, research and engineering but bad at acquisition, bookkeeping and coordination.

The software industry is dominated by extractivist, ableist, patriarchal organisations. Let's stop the competition, the not-good-enough, the self-exploitation. Let's instead cooperate: on the basis of a shared intention and our capacity for companionship, mutual care and learning.

The pope (major arcanum V): 

> "I am first and foremost mediator of myself. Between my sublime spiritual nature and my most instinctive humanity, I have chosen to be the place where they interact. I am at the service of this communication between the high and the low; my mission is to unite apparent opposites. A bridge is not a country, it is merely a place of passage."

> "It is not by isolating myself but by taking all paths that I am able to announce the good news."

> "The cross in my hand is not an instrument for giving orders. It is the symbol of my joyful annihilation."

> "I refuse nobody anything. I am the door that all keys may open."
> "He who has entered my soul can advance to the uttermost limit of the universe and to the end of time: I am the final frontier between words and the unthinkable."

To me, the pope is the figure that helps me imagine deep, nurturing connection in difference. Within oneself and with each other. In that sense, it relates to Donna Haraway's figure of the cyborg. We can't just "go back to nature", a place that never existed. But we can connect with each other, and we can even find ways to subvert the technocratic and hierarchical structures that are ruining the planet.

The pope knows the precondition for constructive horizontal connection: that we first have to concede that we are losing this war. And yet there are so many paths, "taking all paths" is how the pope finds a way. Never the one that leads to harmony. There is no good life in this world but there are paths and we have to take them all.

**Action!**

Frontline communities fighting against extractivism know exactly what needs to be done. We know what our struggle is, and we know that we can be an effective force if we take care. So let's stop compromising and go for it.

The Chariot (major arcanum VII) is an unstoppable force. Its strength comes from logic and intuition, verbal and subconscious awareness joining forces. It sees through the propaganda of fear, uncertainty and doubt. To me, it is also a charm against defaitism and western relativism.

> "I am full, absolutely full, of strength. Nothing is wasted; I am rooted in the planet and a lover of all its energies. They propel my movement. Like a knight of fire, I do not budge from my place. I do not crawl upon the ground. I see on high. I travel with time without ever leaving the moment. Without past, without future, the sole time possible: the present, like a jewel beyond measure. Everything here is nowhere else."

> "I traverse the night of doubt over the abyss of myself. I sever the knot of enigmas, I go beyond the agony of being, I scorn appearances, I free feelings from reason, I destroy all that opposes me, I am what I am."

Less enclosure means more abundance for all of us: Money we don't need immediately is available through our "ATM", a shared pool for money. Without condition or accountability towards Others, each of us can access this money. It is not a separate bank account but consists of any money each of us can decide to put up. It can be regarded as a method to not privatize money prematurely, and for each of us us to unlearn defending financial decisions.

Against patriarchy, and we start from within:
- queer-only
- initiative+veto principle: Anyone can bring in an initiative and find companions. Likely, anyone can stop such initiatives with a veto. There is no such thing as a primacy of majority. One voice counts as much as many.
- Programmed failure
...


How?
COOPERATION
instead of competition

- initiative+veto principle: Anyone can bring in an initiative and find companions. Likely, anyone can stop such initiatives with a veto. There is no such thing as a primacy of majority. One voice counts as much as many.
- Actual trust instead of 'smart contracts' and policing
- Decoupling work from money: Each one according to their needs, each one according to their capacities, each one according to their desires.


What?
ABUNDANCE
instead of scarcity

- Mutual care; collective learning; Tekmil/Feedback; Celebrating
- Opportunistic finding of funding opportunities
- Programmed failure


With whom?
POWER-WITH

- A network of Covens
- Connected by a shared intention
- Following the lead of frontline communities

TODO:


PRACTICAL 

- Conflict resolution, examples, boundaries

- Project: what kind of projects? Tech, domains, priorization, ...

- Financial risks and typical numbers


CLARITY

- What does queer mean?

- Covens?

- Connection to frontline communities


PRIOR ART

- ATM
- Programmed failure, failure criteria, non-commercial projects, commoning
